It's been a long time since his NY struggles. Big arm with one of the quicker releases in the league. And I saw improved accuracy last season, with some high difficulty throws in a offense that does not help its QB.

Put in a tough spot last year, middle of a playoff race vs a brutal schedule w/ diminished supporting cast. 
Pretty strong arm. He's looking to pass, yet can make plays with his legs. I could see him as a starter one day.

Up and down early last season, but came back a different player down the stretch. Knows how to read defenses and move in the pocket. Not a huge arm but can make all the throws. 
Texans may have a diamond in the rough, and he deserves a shot to prove it

A backup I like, but I wish you could depend on him to stay healthy. He has starting QB-worthy qualities. A really good arm, good athlete, but too careful at times (a little like Teddy in that respect).
